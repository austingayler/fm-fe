This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Uses `react-table` for nice data display and `react-google-maps` for displaying satellite imagery and ski line geo data.

To run (assumes npm installation):

    git clone
    Create your own `.env` file, filling in a Google Maps API key
    npm install
    npm start
